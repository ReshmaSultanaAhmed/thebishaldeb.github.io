        <p>
            Kharagpur Winter of Code is a 5-week long online programme for students who are new to open source software development. KWoC provides a great opportunity to get acquainted with Github along with Git commands and contribute to open source efficiently. The programme not only helps students to get involved in open source, but also prepares them for many open source summer programmes; Google Summer of Code being one of them.

        <h3 class="text-center">About Keep Clone</h3>
        <p>
            <a href="https://github.com/nityanandagohain/keep_clone">Keep Clone</a> is an app which is made using reactJS and Firebase Database. I chose it because I'm interested in Web and App development and hence committed myself with its development during this one month period. At the time starting of KWOC, it was in its basic stage with login and SignUp feature and form to enter and store the title and description of notes. But after KWOC, it has developede greatly.

            <p>
                After the addition of option of lists in notes, the UI became very ugly. So I suggested to edit it in this issue.

            <p>
                After the addition of option of canvas in notes, I found out that the drawing goes out the canvas region. So I suggested to solve it in this issue.

            <h5>Delete a user <a href="https://github.com/nityanandagohain/keep_clone/issues/41" target="_blank">#41 </a></h5>
            <p>
                Uptil this stage, the user could only create an account but had no option to delete it. So I suggested this feature. 
            </p>
            <hr class="hr">
            <h5>Addition of footer and appearance in a single page height. <a href="https://github.com/nityanandagohain/keep_clone/issues/45" target="_blank">#45 </a></h5>
            <p>
                Here I suggested to add a footer to contain the delete account button and also suggested to make the app of single page height.

            <p>
                Till then the error was shown using only alert() option. So I suggested to modify it to a better way as in shown in standard apps.

            <p>
                I found that the verifyEmail page doesn't work properly and doesn't redirect to the login page in case of a faulty email used for signup and it stays in that page even after restarting the server.

        <h3 class="text-center">SUMMARY</h3>
        <p>
            Before KWOC I had no knowlege about Git and GitHub but now I'm good enough to start my own project. Thanks to it, I've learned about contribution to Open Source. I'm interested in Web Development but had no idea how to start but now I know. I learnt the technique to sunderstand such huge chunks of code ands use them to my advantage. I've also learned to use ReactJS and Google Firebase which I had no idea about before KWOC. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The project which I worked on also developed by leaps and bounds compared to what it was before the Start of KWOC. My mentor helped me a lot during this period. Thanks to him, I've learnt a great deal.  
        </p>
        <p>
            The KWOC team deserves much gratitude and applaud for organizing such an event.
